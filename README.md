# Helicopter-Prison-Escape
This project is focused on understanding the pattern of prison outbreaks across the world between the year 1971 and 2020
It's about prison breaks, and I will lead you through the code to
    Obtain real data from the internet and prepare it for analysis
    Analyse the data using Python
    Visualise the data
    Author the portfolio project in a Jupyter environment (using JupyterLab), to share code and communicate results
Specifically, we'll answer the following questions:
    In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
    In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison breaks occur?
    What is the ratio of successful breaks to failed ones?
